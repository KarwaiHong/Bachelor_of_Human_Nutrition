<u>Gram Staining:</u>

1. [Preparation] *How did you ensure the bacterial smear was properly heat-fixed on the slide?*

2. [Crystal Violet Application] *What colour did the bacterial smear turn after flooding with crystal violet, and why?*

3. [Iodine Solution] *What is the purpose of iodine solution in Gram staining, and how does it contribute to the staining process?*

4. [Alcohol Decolorization] *Describe the decolorization process. Why is it crucial to rinse immediately after decolorization?*

5. [Safranin Counterstain] *Explain the role of safranin in Gram staining. How does it help in bacterial differentiation?*

6. [Microscopic Examination] *What observations did you make under the microscope? How did you distinguish between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria?*


<u>Acid-fast Staining:</u>

1. [Heat-fixing] *Why is heat-fixing necessary for acid-fast staining?*

2. [Carbol Fuchsin Application] *Describe the significance of carbol fuchsin in acid-fast staining. What is its role in staining mycobacteria?*

3. [Acid-alcohol Decolorization] *Explain the purpose of acid-alcohol in acid-fast staining. What happens during the decolorization step?*

4. [Methylene Blue Counterstain] *Why is methylene blue used as a counterstain, and what is its impact on the staining of mycobacteria?*

5. [Microscopic Examination] *What observations did you make under the microscope after acid-fast staining? How did you identify acid-fast bacteria?*

<u>Lactophenol Cotton Blue Staining:</u>

1. [Wet Mount Preparation] *How did you prepare the wet mount of the fungal or yeast sample?*

2. [Lactophenol Cotton Blue Application] *What role does lactophenol cotton blue play in staining fungi and yeasts?*

3. [Microscopic Examination] *Describe your observations under the microscope. How did you differentiate between different fungal and yeast structures?*
